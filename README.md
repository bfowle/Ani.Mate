Ani.Mate
========

C# port of the Ani.Mate Unity3D tweening library

------------

This lightweight, but powerful tweening ibrary was originally written by Adrian Stutz <adrian.stutz@gmail.com> in Boo. However, iOS Unity does not allow for the compilation and deployment of Boo scripts (as of October 2012).
